# wiki-gene-interactions
A gene interaction database built on Wikipedia mining only. 

Final project in Computational Tools for Data Science. 

--- 

### Time line
#### Main goal 
The project consist of the following tasks for the main goal: 

- __Semester Week 8__: Collect list of all known gene symbols  

- __Semester Week 8__: Implement Bloom Filter and train based on gene data

- __Semester Week 8 + 9__: Figure out how to work with data from Wikipedia and limit our search to links 

- __Semester Week 9 + 10__: Mine for interactions using the Bloom Filter and store in database 
    
#### Subgoals 
The subgoals would be reached by the following tasks:

- __Semester Week 10__: Count number of citation for each interaction, convert to edge weight measure and store this value in the database

- __Semester Week 10 + 11__: Convert database queries to file for visualization tool
