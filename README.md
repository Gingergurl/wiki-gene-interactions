# wiki-gene-interactions
A gene interaction database built on Wikipedia mining only. Final project in Computational Tools for Data Science. 


# Time line
The project consist of the following tasks for the main goal: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Semester Week 8:} Collect list of all known gene symbols  
    \item \textbf{Semester Week 8:} Implement Bloom Filter and train based on gene data
    \item \textbf{Semester Week 9:} Figure out how to work with data from Wikipedia and limit our search to links 
    \item \textbf{Semester Week 9+10:} Mine for interactions using the Bloom Filter and store in database 
    
\end{itemize}
The subgoals would be reached by the following tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Semester Week 10:} Count number of citation for each interaction, convert to edge weight measure and store this value in the database
    \item \textbf{Semester Week 10+11:} Convert database queries to file for visualization tool 
\end{itemize}
